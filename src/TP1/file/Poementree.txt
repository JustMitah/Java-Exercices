I don't want to be a spice store.
I don't want to carry handcrafted Marseille soap,
or tsampa and yak butter,
or nine thousand varieties of wine.
Half the shops here don't open till noon
and even the bookstore's brined in charm.
I want to be the one store that's open all night
and has nothing but necessities.
